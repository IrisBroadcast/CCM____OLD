The IRIS Call Control Manager and discovery service - CCM
=========================================================

* Web Site: https://www.irisbroadcast.org
* Github: https://github.com/irisbroadcast

This is the code for the IRIS Call Control Manager and Discovery
service developed by Sveriges Radio AB in Sweden. This code has
been in production for many years and we're proud to share it
with a larger community!

Release plan after 1.0
======================

This first release is a first, but important, step for us as
maintainers of this Open Source project. The code is licensed
using the BSD 3-clause license and we have gone through the process
internally of releasing in-house software as Open Source.

We will now work to move our in-house development to github
and move our production servers to the Open Source code. This
means that we will release a new set of code at some point
during the first half of 2018 and from that point continue
development in the open on github.

The changes between the 1.0 release and the coming version will
not be committed to the github repository until we have a new
process for our in-house development.

Documentation
=============
This is an area where we need help. As an in-house project
managed by a small and dedicated team, documentation, especially
in english, has not been produced - like how-to's, installation
guides and FAQs. Join the discussion on the github issue tracker
and the coming mailing lists to help us.
